                <p><font color=#ff6161>Weakness:</font> Unlike other ghosts, asking a Demon a successful question via the Ouija Board will not lower players\' sanity. This makes the Ouija Board a very useful tool against Demons.</p>

                <p><font color=#ff6161>Strength:</font> A Jinn\'s speed makes it an extremely difficult ghost to escape from once it begins hunting.</p>
                <p><font color=#ff6161>Weakness:</font> Jinns rely on the map\'s power source to achieve their high speeds, so players should look for the building\'s circuit breaker in order to limit the Jinn\'s abilities.</p>

Should the ghost answer, the Spirit Box is confirmed Evidence. Pointed questions such as \"How old are you?\" or \"Where are you?\" are plausible questions. Do keep in mind that the ghost is always listening regardless if a player is talking into a Spirit Box or not, so players should be careful while speaking in Vicinity chat. Drawing out a ghost can be done by saying their given name numerous times (thus, angering it), and giving it commands like \"Show yourself\" or \"Give us a sign\" seem to be plausible commands.</p>
