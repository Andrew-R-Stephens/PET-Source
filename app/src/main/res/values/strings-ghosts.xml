            <a>Onis are easy to find, as they can\'t resist causing a ruckus when players are nearby. The Oni cannot do a \"Ghost Mist\" or \"Ghost Ball\" event. It will favor full manifestations over shadow manifestations or invisible manifestations during ghost events. This behavior carries into hunts, which causes the Oni to manifest itself for longer periods and disappearing for very short intervals during hunts.</a>

            <a>Players can remove physical objects in the room, rendering a Poltergeist ineffective. A Polgergeist may interact with items violently, being able to throw an item with far greater force than a normal ghost. It may interact with multiple items at the same time, which is known as a "Poltergeist explosion event", and it can be easily tested by accumulating a large number of items into a pile and observing its behavior for activity. During a hunt, items have a far greater chance of being manipulated, so check for numerous aggitated items within its hunting path.</a>
