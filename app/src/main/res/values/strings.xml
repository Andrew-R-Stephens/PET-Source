            <p>The D.O.T.S. Projector is a device which may be placed on walls or the floor. It projects a matrix of bright dots, casting the dots across nearby surfaces around it.</p>
            <p>To positively identify this Evidence, <font color=#ff6161>a silhouette of the ghost will be seen running, or crawling quickly, through the projection\'s beams</font>. The silhouette may be seen by the naked eye or through a Video Camera, but is easier seen <font color=#ff6161>remotely via the Video Camera\'s Thermals</font>. It\'s best to attempt to find this evidence remotely, as a Goryo\'s behavior may cause Evidence conflicts otherwise. The actual location of the Ghost will not dictate when the silhouette animations occur.</p>
             <p>The D.O.T.S. visuals are now the actual ghost, meaning you will need to shine your Infrared lights near the ghost\'s actual position. This creates much more engaging gameplay for players, you can use D.O.T.S. to see where your ghost is, or if you\'re struggling to get the evidence, use Salt, Motion Sensors or other equipment to find a better spot for your Projector. Ghosts with D.O.T.S. evidence can now enter a short \“D.O.T.S. state\” when wandering; During which, they are temporarily visible with infrared light, during this time they will wander towards the nearest player (or to a random spot in the room if it\'s empty) before disappearing.</p>
